# PacMen-Factory

A factory script that creates and launches objects, in this case PacMen. These objects interact and collide with the sides of the webpage. Using collision and Vector math we calculate the direction, velocity, and position of these objects.

##Instructions
Step 1. Download the project
Step 2. Unzip the folder. 
Step 3. Make sure you have a way to host the webpage. (I use XAMPP Control Panel) 
Step 4. Open index.html in any browser. (I use chrome)
Step 5. Press Add PacMen and Start Game to launch your PacMen.

## RoadMap
For further functionallity of this game I would add a score board.
Aswell as a way to click on the Pacmen to Destroy them and add Score.
I would also like to add an automatic spawn for the PacMen.
Finally add a Time limit to challenge the player.
